The project is made in AngularJS and contains 2 apps:
- https://push-me.github.io/eStore/app/admin - administration tool, where a user can manage products and orders
- https://push-me.github.io/eStore/app - e-commerce web app

I am using firebase authentication and firebase database. All apps are mobile friendly.

### Admin app
To get access you need to have admin rights. Ask me and I'll give you the user.
