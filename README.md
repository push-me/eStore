I made these apps for myself, just to try out AngularJS.  

*My latest project in Angular v14 is secured so I can't show you the production,  
but I have it locally and I can screenshare and demonstrate you the code and how it is rendered.*  

It is made in AngularJS and contains 2 apps:
- https://push-me.github.io/eStore/app/admin - administration tool, where a user can manage products and orders
- https://push-me.github.io/eStore/app - e-commerce web app  

I made unit tests using karma and e2e tests using protractor.  
I used firebase authentication and firebase database. All apps are mobile friendly.
